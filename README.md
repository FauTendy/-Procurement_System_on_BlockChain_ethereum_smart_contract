## 【Workflow】
- ① A project is created by a project owner (e.g. Goverment, etc...)
  - smart contract publish NFTs for each project (bit & tender)

<br>

- ② Bidders submit proposal of conditions for a project owner.

<br>

- ③ Once a proposal is chosen, a project owner submit a contract agreement with a chosen bidder.
  - smart contract publish NFTs for each contract （in order to identify owner of each contracts）
    => Each NFT is associated with IPFS backed contract agreement.

<br>

- ④ A project owner (e.g. Goverment, etc...) deposit money for the best bidder.

<br>

- ⑤ Once a selected bidder's efforts is approved, deposited money is transferred into company. (Escrow)
  (All transaction process and financial flows are recorded. It is useful to do a financial investigation)
